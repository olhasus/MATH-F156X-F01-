<h3><p>Blank Assessments will be available on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com" target="_blank"><b style='color:blue !important;'>Gradescope</b></a>?.</p> 
<p>Assessments will be posted in Gradescope the morning of the assessment date. Once the as- sessment is opened the timer will begin. You will have until the timer runs out to complete the assessment, digitize your solutions, upload them into Gradescope, and select the pages for each of your problems.</p> 
<p><li>
If you encounter technical difficulties or there’s an issue with timing, you need to immediately email your instructor with details and include a scan of your quiz (if possible) in the email. 
</li></p>
<p><li>  
If you are writing your quiz on paper, you will need to scan or photoscan (using a scanning app on your smartphone), or save your work as a PDF if you are working on a computer or tablet.

Links to this semester’s Assessments, and solutions, will appear here as they are completed.
